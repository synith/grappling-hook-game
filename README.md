## Readme
____

This was initially supposed to be a game jam project which ended up with me biting off more than I could chew as it wasn't near playable at the end of the jam.
It was my first attempt at a 3d game, a third person platformer where you use a grappling hook to collect objects throughout the map to finish the level.
I decided to continue working on it thinking it would only take me another week or two to finish but it's been over 5 weeks now, whoops.
