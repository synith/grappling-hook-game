This was initially supposed to be a game jam project that was me biting off more than I could chew as the it wasn't near playable at the end of the jam.
It was my first attempt at a 3d game, a third person platformer where you use a grappling hook to collect objects throughout the map to finish the level.
I decided to continue working on it thinking it would only take me another week or two to finish but it's been over 5 weeks now, whoops.

This is now a learning project that I intend to use on my portfolio to highlight my Unity 3D skills. I assume it will take another week or two to finish
